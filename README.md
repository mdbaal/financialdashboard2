# financialdashboard2
I am using this project to get more proficient with Laravel (12) and to learn Vue and Inertia as well. In addition I will be using Jira for managing my tasks and trying out their keyed connection to the repository.
And of course I plan on using it once I have finished the project.

The project is a simple dashboard to keep track of your finances manually. Once registered you can start creating accounts and within those accounts you add, edit or remove transactions.
You can add those transactions to categories which will allow you to filter them and get more information about where your money is comming from and going to.
By using tables and graphs you will be able to get easy insight into your finances.

Once the basic of te dashboard are done and working, I am planning on adding an import function to add the csv exports from different banks.
This way you can decide to just regularly add and update an account to get the insights or use it as an accurate starting point to manually build on.
Or maybe you make one for your cash which you manage manually and one or two for you bank accounts that you update every month.
